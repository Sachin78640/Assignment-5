Promises are objects in JavaScript that represent the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation and allow for more structured and intuitive handling of asynchronous code. They provide a way to manage and coordinate asynchronous operations, making code more readable and maintainable.

Promises have three states:

1. Pending: The initial state when a Promise is created and has not yet been fulfilled or rejected.

2. Fulfilled: The state of a Promise when the asynchronous operation is completed successfully, resulting in a resolved value.

3. Rejected: The state of a Promise when the asynchronous operation encounters an error or is unsuccessful, resulting in a reason for rejection.

Promises have several methods to handle and interact with asynchronous operations. Here are three commonly used methods:

1. `then()`:
   - The `then()` method is used to handle the successful fulfillment of a Promise.
   - It takes one or two arguments: a callback function to handle the resolved value, and an optional callback function to handle errors/rejections.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fetchData()
       .then(function(data) {
         // Handle the resolved value
       })
       .catch(function(error) {
         // Handle errors/rejections
       });
     ```

2. `catch()`:
   - The `catch()` method is used to handle any errors or rejections that occur in the Promise chain.
   - It takes a single argument: a callback function to handle the rejection reason.
   - It is typically chained after one or more `then()` methods to handle any potential errors.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fetchData()
       .then(function(data) {
         // Handle the resolved value
       })
       .catch(function(error) {
         // Handle errors/rejections
       });
     ```

3. `finally()`:
   - The `finally()` method is used to specify a callback function that is always executed regardless of whether the Promise is fulfilled or rejected.
   - It allows you to perform cleanup tasks or handle common logic that needs to execute regardless of the Promise's outcome.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     fetchData()
       .then(function(data) {
         // Handle the resolved value
       })
       .catch(function(error) {
         // Handle errors/rejections
       })
       .finally(function() {
         // Cleanup or common logic
       });
     ```

These three methods, `then()`, `catch()`, and `finally()`, provide a way to handle and respond to the different outcomes of Promises: successful fulfillment, errors/rejections, and common cleanup or logic.

Promises also have additional methods and functionalities, such as `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, and the ability to create new Promises using `Promise.resolve()` and `Promise.reject()`, which further enhance the capabilities of working with asynchronous code in JavaScript.
