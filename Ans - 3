Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` are built-in functions in JavaScript that allow you to schedule the execution of code at specified time intervals. They are commonly used for implementing timers and executing functions periodically.

1. `setTimeout`:
   - The `setTimeout` function is used to schedule the execution of a function once after a specified delay.
   - It takes two parameters: a function or code to execute, and a delay in milliseconds.
   - After the specified delay, the function/code is executed once.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     setTimeout(function() {
       console.log("Delayed execution");
     }, 2000); // Executes the function after a delay of 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds)
     ```

2. `setInterval`:
   - The `setInterval` function is used to repeatedly execute a function at a specified time interval.
   - It takes two parameters: a function or code to execute, and a delay in milliseconds.
   - The function/code is executed repeatedly at the specified interval until it is cleared using `clearInterval`.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     let counter = 0;
     const intervalId = setInterval(function() {
       console.log("Interval execution");
       counter++;
       if (counter === 5) {
         clearInterval(intervalId); // Stops the interval after 5 executions
       }
     }, 1000); // Executes the function every 1000 milliseconds (1 second)
     ```

Both `setTimeout` and `setInterval` return a numeric identifier (timeout ID or interval ID) that can be used to clear or cancel the timer before its execution is completed. You can use `clearTimeout` with a timeout ID to cancel a specific `setTimeout` invocation, and `clearInterval` with an interval ID to stop a specific `setInterval` execution.

It's important to note that the actual execution of the function/code might not occur exactly at the specified time interval due to factors like the JavaScript event loop and other running code. Therefore, there might be slight variations in the timing, and the exact interval cannot be guaranteed.

These timer functions are often used for various purposes such as animating elements, scheduling updates, fetching data at regular intervals, and implementing time-based events in JavaScript applications.
