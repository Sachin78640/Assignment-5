To define an asynchronous function using async/await in JavaScript, you need to follow these steps:

1. Use the `async` keyword:
   - Begin by adding the `async` keyword before the function declaration or function expression.
   - This signifies that the function will contain asynchronous operations and will return a Promise.

2. Use the `await` keyword:
   - Inside the async function, use the `await` keyword before any Promise-based asynchronous operation that you want to await the completion of.
   - The `await` keyword pauses the execution of the function until the awaited Promise is resolved or rejected.

3. Handle errors:
   - Wrap the `await` statement inside a `try-catch` block to handle any potential errors that may occur during the asynchronous operation.

Here's an example that demonstrates the definition of an asynchronous function using async/await:

```javascript
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    // Asynchronous operation (e.g., API call, database query)
    const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
    const data = await response.json();

    // Process the retrieved data
    return data;
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
    console.log('An error occurred:', error);
    throw error; // Rethrow the error or handle it gracefully
  }
}
```

In the above code, the `fetchData` function is defined as an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword. Inside the function, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution until the Promise returned by the `fetch` function is resolved. Similarly, the `await` keyword is used to pause the execution until the Promise returned by `response.json()` is resolved.

By using async/await, the code structure appears more synchronous and readable, even though it is handling asynchronous operations. The use of try-catch blocks allows for proper error handling within the function.

When calling the `fetchData` function, you can use it in an asynchronous manner as well:

```javascript
async function myFunction() {
  try {
    const result = await fetchData();
    // Process the result
  } catch (error) {
    // Handle errors
    console.log('An error occurred:', error);
  }
}
```

The `myFunction` is also declared as an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword. Inside this function, the `await` keyword is used to wait for the completion of the `fetchData` function, and any errors are caught and handled in the catch block.

Using async/await provides a more readable and intuitive way to write asynchronous code in JavaScript, making it easier to work with Promises and handle the results of asynchronous operations.
